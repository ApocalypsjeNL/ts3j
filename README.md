# ts3j
TS3J is an open-source implementation of the reverse-engineered Teamspeak3 full server/client protocol, as an adaptation of Splamy's TS3Client source code.

The aim of this project is to provide a full client, capable of performing all functions a full client can, and eventually a server platform API as well.  This project is not intended to be a bot or server itself, and only aims to be an API to interact with the client or server sockets.

This project is currently not completed but is being actively worked on until it is stable and working.  I'm very open to suggestions and contributions should you want to make any, so we can make this a reality faster.
